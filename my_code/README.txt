1.All data analysis from raw traces was performed with LabVEIW proprietary code.
2.The data was then imported into Python for the purpose of creating a Machine Learning Model.
3.In this case, we employed eight different classification models to create an ML model for event type classification
and found three models that performed with 93 percent accuracy.
4.At the moment, the data cannot be released here because the raw data will be used for future publications.
