# Single_Molecule_Event_Classification

## Introduction:

In this study I build a custmom made Machine Learning work flow for classifying different folding state of a molecule (polymer) from acquired event characteristics.
Events from measurement with poylmers with different folding state can be classified automatically with general accuracy of 93%.
